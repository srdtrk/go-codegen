# `ExecuteMsg`

The `ExecuteMsg` is the message that is used to interact with the `cw-ica-controller` contract.
**All execute messages are only callable by the owner of the contract.**

## `CreateChannel`

```rust reference
https://github.com/srdtrk/cw-ica-controller/blob/v0.5.0/src/types/msg.rs#L27-L37
```

This message is used to initiate an ICS-27 channel open handshake. It is only callable by the owner.
This message only takes one optional parameter: `channel_open_init_options`.

If this parameter is left empty, then the contract will use the `channel_open_init_options` that were last
passed to the `InstantiateMsg` or `CreateChannel` messages.

If this parameter is set, then the contract will use the `channel_open_init_options` that are passed to this
message and save them for future `CreateChannel` messages.

## `CloseChannel`

```rust reference
https://github.com/srdtrk/cw-ica-controller/blob/v0.5.0/src/types/msg.rs#L38-L39
```

This message is used to close the ICS-27 channel. It is only callable by the owner.
The channel can then be reopened with parameters (e.g. channel ordering and version) that are different from the
original channel open handshake.

## `SendCosmosMsgs`

```rust reference
https://github.com/srdtrk/cw-ica-controller/blob/v0.5.0/src/types/msg.rs#L40-L54
```

Once an ICS-27 channel open handshake is complete, the owner can control the interchain account on the counterparty
chain. To give the owner a familiar interface, this message allows the owner to take actions with the interchain
account using `CosmosMsg`s. This is the recommended way to use the interchain account. We will go over the fields of
this message in detail.

### `messages`

This is a list of `CosmosMsg`s that the contract will execute on the counterparty chain using the interchain account.
This execution is atomic. If any of the `CosmosMsg`s fail, then the entire execution will fail.

:::note

All applicable `CosmosMsg`s are supported if the channel was opened with `tx_encoding` set to `proto3`.
However, if the channel was opened with `tx_encoding` set to `proto3json`, then some `CosmosMsg`s are not supported.
Below is a table of the supported `CosmosMsg`s for each `tx_encoding`.

|                **CosmosMsg**               | `proto3` | `proto3json` |
|:------------------------------------------:|:--------:|:------------:|
|                 `Stargate`                 |     ‚úÖ    |       ‚ùå      |
|               `BankMsg::Send`              |     ‚úÖ    |       ‚úÖ      |
|               `BankMsg::Burn`              |     ‚ùå    |       ‚ùå      |
|             `IbcMsg::Transfer`             |     ‚úÖ    |       üü¢      |
|            `IbcMsg::SendPacket`            |    N/A   |      N/A     |
|           `IbcMsg::CloseChannel`           |    N/A   |      N/A     |
|                `WasmMsg::*`                |     ‚úÖ    |       ‚ùå      |
|                 `GovMsg::*`                |     ‚úÖ    |       ‚úÖ      |
|           `StakingMsg::Delegate`           |     ‚úÖ    |       ‚úÖ      |
|               `StakingMsg::*`              |     üü¢    |       üü¢      |
| `DistributionMsg::WithdrawDelegatorReward` |     üü¢    |       üü¢      |
|            `DistributionMsg::*`            |     ‚úÖ    |       ‚úÖ      |

Note that `üü¢` means that the `CosmosMsg` is supported but not tested in the contract's test suite.
These will be tested in the future.

### `packet_memo`

This is the IBC packet memo that will be included in the ICS-27 packet. It is optional and defaults to `""`.
Additionally, the memo field is used by some IBC middleware to execute custom logic on the counterparty chain.
But most of these middlewares do not yet support ICS-27 channels.

### `timeout_seconds`

This is the timeout in seconds that will be used for the ICS-27 packet. It is optional and defaults to [`DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`](https://github.com/srdtrk/cw-ica-controller/blob/v0.5.0/src/ibc/types/packet.rs#L15-L16).

## `SendCustomIcaMessages`

```rust reference
https://github.com/srdtrk/cw-ica-controller/blob/v0.5.0/src/types/msg.rs#L55-L91
```

Recall that the `SendCosmosMsgs` message is the recommended way to use the interchain account. Use this only if you
insist on using `proto3json` encoding and you need to send messages that are not supported by the `SendCosmosMsgs`.

:::note

This message is redundant if the channel was opened with `tx_encoding` set to `proto3`. This is because any custom
message you might want to send will be supported through `CosmosMsg::Stargate`.

:::

I will not go into the details of the fields of this message since it is not recommended to use this message.

## `UpdateCallbackAddress`

```rust reference
https://github.com/srdtrk/cw-ica-controller/blob/v0.5.0/src/types/msg.rs#L92-L97
```

This message is used to update the contract address that this contract will send callbacks to.
This is useful if the owner wants to change the contract that receives the callbacks.
If set to `None`, then no callbacks will be sent.

## `UpdateOwnership`

```rust reference
https://github.com/larry0x/cw-plus-plus/blob/ownable-v0.5.0/packages/ownable/derive/src/lib.rs#L86-L90
```

This message type is provided by the [cw-ownable](https://crates.io/crates/cw-ownable) crate. It wraps a
`cw_ownable::Action` enum.

```rust reference
https://github.com/larry0x/cw-plus-plus/blob/ownable-v0.5.0/packages/ownable/src/lib.rs#L31-L57
```

The owner can propose to transfer the ownership of the contract to a new address using `Action::TransferOwnership` and
set and expiry time for the proposal. If the proposal is accepted before the expiry time through
`Action::AcceptOwnership`, then the ownership of the contract is transferred to the new address.

You can learn more about `cw-ownable` in its crate documentation.
