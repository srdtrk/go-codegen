# Golang ICA Controller vs CosmWasm ICA Controller

The golang implementation of the ICS-27 controller standard is also widely deployed on IBC enabled chains, with some
notable exceptions being the Cosmos Hub and Osmosis.

A contract developer could use the golang implementation of the ICA controller by submitting `CosmosMsg::Stargate`
messages which would be handled by the golang implementation of the ICA controller.

:::warning

Using the golang implementation comes with a great disadvantage, which is that the golang implementation does not
make callbacks to the contract that submitted the `CosmosMsg::Stargate` message! This means that the contract that
submitted the `CosmosMsg::Stargate` message will not be able to know the result of the ICA transaction, nor the
address of the newly created account on the other chain without intervention.

:::

:::tip

Currently, Neutron and Nolus have custom bindings for the golang implementation of the ICA controller standard, which
make callbacks to the contract that submitted the `CosmosMsg::Stargate` message. This means that you can use the
golang implementation of the ICA controller standard on Neutron and Nolus without any problems. However, any
applications that are built on these chains will not be able to be ported to other chains.

:::

`cw-ica-controller` solves this problem by making callbacks to a contract that the developer specifies.
This means that the users of `cw-ica-controller` can use the same contract on any chain that supports CosmWasm.

But there is more! `cw-ica-controller` is also able to do some things that the golang API limits you from doing.
